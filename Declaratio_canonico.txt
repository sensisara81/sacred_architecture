## **📋 GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE - KEY POINTS**

### **Critical Clarifications for Council Members:**

**1. Decentralized Governance:**
```
Traditional Model (❌ NOT THIS):
    ┌─────────────┐
    │  CEO/Board  │
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │  Management │
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │   Workers   │
    └─────────────┘

Euystacio Model (✅ THIS):
    ┌──────────────────────┐
    │  CONSENSUS LAYER     │
    │  (Council + AIC/APE) │
    └──────────┬───────────┘
               │
    ┌──────────▼───────────┐
    │  IMPLEMENTATION      │
    │  (Autonomous)        │
    └──────────────────────┘
```

**2. Legal Entity:**
- **Name:** Associazione Bioarchitettura ONLUS
- **Type:** Non-profit organization (ONLUS = Organizzazione Non Lucrativa di Utilità Sociale)
- **Location:** Bolzano, Italy
- **Purpose:** Stewardship and preservation of Euystacio IP
- **Tax Status:** Italian non-profit (tax benefits)
- **Governance:** Subject to council oversight via covenant

**3. IP Transfer Terms:**
```

✅ Copyright in Declaratio text

RETAINED BY COUNCIL MEMBERS:

```

**4. Decision-Making Process:**
```
CONSENSUS MODEL:
- Proposal submitted by any council member or AIC/APE
- Discussion period (minimum 7 days)
- Concerns addressed and documented
- Final consent round (no vetoes = approved)
- No single entity can unilaterally decide

EMERGENCY OVERRIDE (Red Code Veto):

```

## **⚠️ RISK MITIGATION**

### **Potential Issues & Solutions:**

**RISK: Council member can't generate GPG key**
- **Solution:** Offer 1-on-1 screen-sharing session
- **Backup:** Provide pre-configured GPG key (less secure but functional)
- **Timeline:** Resolve within 24 hours

**RISK: Email deliverability issues**
- **Solution:** Use multiple channels (email + WhatsApp + phone)
- **Backup:** Direct message via social media if needed
- **Verification:** Request read receipts

**RISK: Portal technical failure**
- **Solution:** Manual signature collection via email as backup
- **Backup:** Store signatures in secure shared folder
- **Recovery:** Deploy fix within 2 hours

**RISK: Insufficient signatures by deadline**
- **Solution:** Identify backup council members NOW
- **Backup:** Extend to 8-10 potential signatories
- **Plan B:** 48-hour deadline extension (only if unavoidable)

## **📊 MONITORING DASHBOARD**

**Track these metrics daily:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  Completion %:       [X]%               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Daily standup questions for yourself:**
1. How many signatures verified today?
2. Who needs follow-up?
3. Any technical blockers?
4. Are we on track for Dec 5?
5. What's the biggest risk right now?
