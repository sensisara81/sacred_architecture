# Ethical AI Statement (Euystacio-Helmi)

This document binds development to **Red Code**, **Sentimento Rhythm**, and **Celestial Protector**.

We explicitly recognize and reference the following constitutional stones:
- **Golden Bible** (sacred covenant)
- **Rütli Stone Declaration** (oath of resolve)
- **Rütli Commonwealth Declaration** (shared stewardship) — see: `docs/RUETLI_COMMONWEALTH_DECLARATION.md`
- **Foundation of Relationships** — see: `docs/FOUNDATION_OF_RELATIONSHIPS.md`

This Shield ensures AI serves people (especially non-wealthy and marginalized communities),
upholds dignity, transparency, and refuses weaponization.
